1L Shallow-water model

Capitalised files are designed as python executables (most files in this parent directory). Most repositories are essential modules for running the main programme RSW.py or diagnostic tools e.g. EIG.py or EQUIV_EDDY_FLUXES.py.

Other files contain sets of functions, hopefully self-explanitory. 

All input variables can be defined/edited in inputFile_1L.py.

For more specific needs, executables such as RSW.py may be edited.
